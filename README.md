# M-sequence
Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequences are commonly used to generate noise that is approximately "white".
It has applications in scrambling, cryptography, and spread-spectrum communications. It is also commonly
referred to as the Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). 
This code takes polynomials as input during runtime to generate m-sequence.
