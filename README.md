# M-sequence
Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequences are commonly used to generate noise that is approximately "white".
It has applications in scrambling, cryptography, and spread-spectrum communications.
A maximum length sequence is a type of pseudorandom binary sequence. They are bit sequences generated using maximal linear feedback shift registers and are so called because they are periodic and reproduce every binary sequence that can be represented by the shift registers.
This code takes polynomials as input during runtime to generate m-sequence.
