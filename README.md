# M-sequence
Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequences are commonly used to generate noise that is approximately "white".
It has applications in scrambling, cryptography, and spread-spectrum communications.
A maximum length sequence is a type of pseudorandom binary sequence. They are bit sequences generated using maximal linear feedback shift registers and are so called because they are periodic and reproduce every binary sequence that can be represented by the shift registers.
This code takes polynomials as input during runtime to generate m-sequence.

# Gold Sequence
Gold code, also known as Gold sequence, is a type of binary sequence, used in telecommunication (CDMA)[1] and satellite navigation. Gold sequences belong to the category of  product codes where two m-sequences of same length are XORâ€™ed to produce a Gold sequence. The two m-sequence must maintain the same phase relationship till all the additions are performed. A slight change of phase even in one of the m-sequences, produces a different Gold sequence altogether. Gold codes are non-maximal and therefore they have poor auto-correlation property when compared to that of the underlying m-sequences.
